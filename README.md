# A cleaning needed to be done. I had to restart a couple of times due to my misunderstanding of the data in the columns
# After cleaning the columns that had repeated data I procedeed and cleaned the rows that had missing values, specifically in the dates
# When I was done with this, I continued to standarized the names of the columns
# I finally filtered the dates to get the right amount of information and I filtered by date, from 1960 until the present, which returned info until at least 2020, as we can see in the first histogram.
# After this I realized that many of the columns had similar non-null values expect from age which had the lowest non-null values 
# Based on the columns that I have at the time I'm going to start drawing what will be my hypothesis for the next analysis: 
    ### 1st country /area vs. species --> The region of the world determines the number of attacks
    ### 2nd year (date) vs fatal --> Depedending on the year of the attack, the fatality of the injury variates
    ### 3rd species vs. fatal --> The shark species determines the fatality of the attack/injury

# These shall be my 3 hypotheses and will be demonstrated through visualizations and comparisions.
